Getting used to java syntax

                

                things to remember:

                it is \"true\" not \"True\" with bools

                System.out.println(\"Hello\" + variableName);

                

                The byte data type can store whole numbers from -128 to 127.

                This can be used instead of int or other integer types to save memory when you are certain

                that the value will be within -128 and 127.

                

                The 'short' data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767.

                

                The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.

                This is used when int is not large enough to store the value.

                Note that you should end the value with an \"L\".

                

                The float and double data types can store fractional numbers.

                Note that you should end the value with an \"f\" for floats and \"d\" for doubles:

                d=more decimal points, f=less.

                

                A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an \"e\" to indicate the power of 10:

                float f1 = 35e3f;

                double d1 = 12E4d;

                

                smallest to largest:

                byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

                

                String len found w .length()

                

                .toLowerCase()

                .toUpperCase()

                JAVA HAS IT YES!!!!

                

                .indexOf(\"letter\") finds the position of a certain item in a string, im sure it works w arrays

                too

                

                System.out.println(string1.concat(string2));

                puts both strings together like System.out.println(string1+\"\"+string2);

                

                to use an escape character put a backslash in front of it

                

                Math dictionary has min(x,y),max(x,y),sqrt(square root),abs(absolute value),random (between 0.0, 1.0)

                multiply it to get bigger random numbers

                

                bool can be (10<9) returns false bc not true, 10==10 returns true

                

                ? and : can work as an if else statement

                EX:

                String result = (time < 18) ? \"Good day.\" : \"Good evening.\";

                if time<18 it prints \"Good day.\" otherwise it prints \"Good evening\"

                

                switch statements function as if else

                EX:

                int day=4;

                switch(day){

                case 1:

                System.out.println(\"monday\");

                break;

                ETCETERA ETCETERA

                default:

                System.out.println(\"not a day in the week\");

                }

                

                default works like the final else

                

                do{

                }

                while(conditions);

                works too

                

                for each works like for each item in list run loop yf

                EX:

                String[] cars = {\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \"Ford\", \"Mazda\"};

                for (String i : cars) {

                  System.out.println(i);

                }

                would run 4 times

                

                continue; stops a loop for one iteration, slightly less powerful break;

                

                ARRAYS WORK LIKE PYTHON NOT C!!!

                String[] cars = {\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \"Ford\", \"Mazda\"};

                

                A multidimensional array is an array of arrays.

                Multidimensional arrays are useful when you want to store data as a tabular form, like a table with rows and columns.

                To create a two-dimensional array, add each array within its own set of curly braces:

                

                int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };

                for (int i = 0; i < myNumbers.length; ++i) {

                  for (int j = 0; j < myNumbers[i].length; ++j) {

                    System.out.println(myNumbers[i][j]);

                  }

                }

                int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };

                for (int[] row : myNumbers) {

                  for (int i : row) {

                    System.out.println(i);

                  }

                }

                both do the same thing

                

                If you want the method to return a value,

                you can use a primitive data type (such as int, char, etc.) instead of void,

                 and use the return keyword inside the method:

                

                public class Main {

                  static int myMethod(int x, int y) {

                    return x + y;

                  }

                

                  public static void main(String[] args) {

                    System.out.println(myMethod(5, 3));

                  }

                }

                Outputs 8 (5 + 3)

                

                Overloading a method is remaking a method with the new data type but the same name

                it is for concise and neat looking code

                EX:

                static int plusMethod(int x, int y) {

                  return x + y;

                }

                

                static double plusMethod(double x, double y) {

                  return x + y;

                }

                

                public static void main(String[] args) {

                  int myNum1 = plusMethod(8, 5);

                  double myNum2 = plusMethod(4.3, 6.26);

                  System.out.println(\"int: \" + myNum1);

                  System.out.println(\"double: \" + myNum2);

                }

                

                Java uses scope and therefore any variables within one particular method (around curly brackets)

                are accessible everywhere withing said scope.

                

                To create multiple class calls you have to create multiple class objects

                EX:
 Main myObj1 = new Main(); 
 Main myObj2 = new Main();
                

                When using static method you ----->DO NOT<----- have to create a whole obj for it

                EX: you can call a static method using just myStaticMethod() while a public method need

                Main myObj = new Main();
myObj.myPublicMethod;

                
As long as a variable is defined in the same class it can be used throughout any methods within that class, it's called an attribute when it does that.

If you make 2 classes you must use:
ClassName newVar = new ClassName();
System.out.println(myVar.X);

You can change attributes in methods. But it cannot be changed if you put 'final' before the declaration.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS A C CONCEPT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

understanding pointers: when putting a "*" in front of a variable name it's saying it will point to the location of the variable
what this does is allow for values to be accessed by address, and therefore be able to be changed thru just pointing at the address.
what this does is allow a pointer to find the start of an array, and then change the values in the said array by changing the values
within the memory theyre being held. EX:
5. Arrays and Pointers:
Arrays are closely related to pointers. The name of an array decays into a pointer to the first element of the array.
C

   int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   int *ptr = arr; // ptr points to the first element of the array

   printf("%d\n", *ptr); // Prints 1
   printf("%d\n", *(ptr + 1)); // Prints 
   
the flaw of this is that if you let say do *(ptr +100000) and theres nothing at 1000000 then you will get a null pointer. the pointer points at nothing.

Naming conventions in java MATTER. When you have a public class you HAVE to have a constructor share a name with it or else it doesn't work!
what you put in front of the variable name determine not only what type of data type being stored
but ALSO how accessible the variables are. for example a "public" variable can be accessed anywhere in the program
whereas a private variable can only be accessed in the same class. essentially make all date private.


final variables mean they cannot be inherited in any other classes
